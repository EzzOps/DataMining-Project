# This console app assists decision-making by evaluating various alternatives based on user-inputted expected values.

# The app considers different decision criteria, each providing a unique perspective on selecting the most favorable alternative.

# Function to collect user input:
# - Users input the number of alternatives and market states.
# - For each alternative, users provide the name and expected values for each market state.
# - The app stores this information in a table for analysis.

# Functions implementing decision-making criteria:
# - Maximax: Selects the alternative with the highest maximum payoff, providing an optimistic approach.
# - Maximin: Chooses the alternative with the highest minimum payoff, focusing on risk aversion.
# - Hurwicz: Offers a compromise between optimism and risk aversion, allowing users to specify their optimism coefficient.
# - Equally Likely: Assumes equal likelihood of market states and selects the alternative with the highest average payoff.
# - Minimax Regret: Identifies the alternative with the smallest maximum regret, considering missed opportunities.

# Main function:
# - Gathers user input and displays the results for each decision criterion.
# - Users can make informed decisions based on their risk preferences and the nature of the decision-making scenario.

# Entry point of the program:
# - The main function is executed when the script is run.

# Overall, the app provides a versatile tool for decision-makers, allowing them to explore multiple decision criteria and make informed choices based on their preferences and the nature of the decision context.
