1. **Import necessary libraries**: This is like gathering the tools you need. These tools include a way to work with regular expressions (re), analyze text (TextBlob), and remove common words (stopwords from nltk.corpus).

    ```python
    import re
    from textblob import TextBlob
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    ```

2. **Define a sample text**: This is our starting point. It's a sentence that we're going to analyze. In a real-world scenario, this could be a review, a tweet, a comment, etc.

    ```python
    sample_text = "I love this product! It's amazing and works perfectly."
    ```

3. **Text Mining Preprocessing**: We're cleaning up our text. We're removing extra spaces, special characters, URLs, and common words (like 'the', 'is', 'at', 'which', and 'on'). It's like cleaning and preparing your work area before starting a project.

    ```python
    def preprocess_text(text):
        text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
        text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
        text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)
        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
        text = ' '.join(word.lower() for word in text.split() if word.lower() not in stop_words)
        return text

    preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)
    ```

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: We're determining whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. It's like reading a review and deciding whether the person liked, disliked, or felt indifferent about their experience.

    ```python
    def analyze_sentiment(text):
        blob = TextBlob(text)
        sentiment = 'Positive' if blob.sentiment.polarity > 0 else 'Negative' if blob.sentiment.polarity < 0 else 'Neutral'
        return sentiment

    sentiment_result = analyze_sentiment(preprocessed_text)
    ```

5. **Print the results**: We're displaying the original text, the cleaned-up text, and the result of our sentiment analysis.

    ```python
    print("Original Text:", sample_text)
    print("Preprocessed Text:", preprocessed_text)
    print("Sentiment Analysis Result:", sentiment_result)
    ```

This explanation avoids technical jargon and uses simple analogies to explain the process. It should be easier for someone without a data science background to understand.
