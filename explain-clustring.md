1. **Import necessary libraries**: This is like gathering the tools you need. These tools include ways to organize data (pandas), create plots (matplotlib), group similar items together (KMeans from sklearn.cluster), standardize data (StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing), and reduce the dimensionality of data (PCA from sklearn.decomposition).

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    ```

2. **Load the dataset**: This is like opening a book to read it. We're opening our dataset, which in this case is the Iris dataset.

    ```python
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    iris = load_iris()
    data = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
    ```

3. **Print the first few rows of the dataset**: This is just to get a quick peek at the data, like reading the first page of a book.

    ```python
    print("Preview of the dataset:")
    print(data.head())
    ```

4. **Data preprocessing**: We're simplifying our data. We're dropping some columns and standardizing the features. It's like cleaning and preparing your work area before starting a project.

    ```python
    X = data.drop(columns=['sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'target'])
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    ```

5. **Apply K-Means clustering algorithm**: This is where we're grouping similar items together. We're showing it the data and asking it to divide it into 3 groups (clusters).

    ```python
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
    clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)
    ```

6. **Visualize the results using PCA**: We're creating a plot to visualize our clusters. We're using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of our data, making it easier to plot.

    ```python
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
    plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis', edgecolors='k', s=50)
    plt.title('K-Means Clustering Results')
    plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
    plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
    plt.show()
    ```

7. **Discuss the obtained results**: This is where you would talk about the clusters and how well they separate the data based on the features. This step doesn't involve any code, but it's an important part of the data analysis process.
