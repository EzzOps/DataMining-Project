1. **Import necessary libraries**: This is like gathering the tools you need to work. These tools include ways to organize data (pandas), split data (train_test_split), convert text to numbers (TfidfVectorizer), make predictions (LogisticRegression), and measure how well we did (accuracy_score).
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```
2. **Load the data**: This is like opening a book to read it. We're opening our dataset, which is stored in a CSV file.
    ```python
    mail_data = pd.read_csv('/content/mail_data.csv').fillna('')
    ```
3. **Print the first 5 rows**: This is just to get a quick peek at the data, like reading the first page of a book.
    ```python
    print(mail_data.head())
    ```
4. **Convert spam and ham labels to 0 and 1**: We're simplifying the labels in our data. Instead of 'spam' and 'ham', we're using 1 and 0. It's like saying 'yes' (1) or 'no' (0) to the question "Is this email spam?".
    ```python
    mail_data['Category'] = (mail_data['Category'] == 'spam').astype(int)
    ```
5. **Separate the data into texts and labels**: We're dividing our data into two parts. One part (X) is the email text we'll use to make our predictions. The other part (Y) is the answer we're trying to predict (is it spam or not?).
    ```python
    X = mail_data['Message']
    Y = mail_data['Category']
    ```
6. **Split the data into training and testing sets**: We're setting some data aside (20%) to test how well our prediction model works later. It's like saving some questions from a textbook to use as a practice test later.
    ```python
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)
    ```
7. **Convert text data to feature vectors**: This is a fancy way of saying we're turning the text into numbers that our prediction model can understand. It's like translating a book into another language.
    ```python
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=1, stop_words='english', lowercase=True)
    X_train_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_features = vectorizer.transform(X_test)
    ```
8. **Train a Logistic Regression model**: This is where we're teaching our model to make predictions. We're showing it the email texts and the correct answers (spam or not), so it can learn the patterns.
    ```python
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train_features, Y_train)
    ```
9. **Evaluate the model on training data**: We're checking how well our model has learned from the training data. It's like taking a practice test right after studying a chapter.
    ```python
    train_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_train, model.predict(X_train_features))
    print('Accuracy on training data:', train_accuracy)
    ```
10. **Evaluate the model on test data**: Now we're giving our model a final exam, using the data we set aside earlier. This tells us how well our model can predict spam emails it hasn't seen before.
    ```python
    test_accuracy = accuracy_score(Y_test, model.predict(X_test_features))
    print('Accuracy on test data:', test_accuracy)
    ```
11. **Make a prediction on new input mail**: We're using our trained model to predict whether a new email is spam or not. It's like using what you've learned to answer a new question.
    ```python
    input_mail = ["I've been searching for the right words to thank you for this breather. I promise I won't take your help for granted and will fulfill my promise. You have been wonderful and a blessing at all times"]
    input_data_features = vectorizer.transform(input_mail)
    prediction = model.predict(input_data_features)
    ```
12. **Print the result**: We're displaying the result of our prediction. If the model predicts the email is not spam (ham), it prints a message saying so. If it predicts the email is spam, it gives a warning.
    ```python
    if prediction[0] == 1:
        print('This looks like a Ham (non-spam) mail!')
    else:
        print('Warning! This might be a Spam mail!')
    ```
